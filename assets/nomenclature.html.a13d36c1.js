A hierarchical nomenclature is selected to provide the maximum level of flexibility of classifications. Three fields are required to create a Taxon Name record in the database: <code>name</code>, <code>parent</code>, and <code>taxonomic rank</code>. The Parent is any valid taxon of a rank higher than a new one. This section is the only section of the form which requires the use of the Save button. All other sections of the form use autosave mode.</p><p>The highest rank taxon in a hierarchy is <code>Root</code>. This is a default Taxon and can not be modified, it is created when the project is first initiated. The first taxon attached to the Root requires selection of the Code of Nomenclature (ICZN, ICN, ICNP, ICTV), this is required to enforce validation rules specific to this particular Code of Nomenclature. All taxa below this taxon do not require selection of the Code, it will be inherited from the parent.

This is incredibly liberating in many ways, as the system will resolve the current status by inferring across the facts that you have added. As an example, rather than think &quot;how do I change this name to invalid&quot;, think &quot;how do I add the fact that so and so stated this name is invalid&quot;. The name was valid in the past, now we add a fact to indicate somebody more recently thinks it&#39;s invalid. The system will look at the years the facts were applied, summarize the facts as we presently see them. This also lets the complete nomenclatural history, in all its gory detail be recorded.</p><h3 id="authorship" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authorship" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Authorship</h3><p>This section describes how data are used to set <code>original authorship</code> of the name (as opposed to a subsequent citation).

Remember, that <em>nomen novum</em> cannot be proposed for misapplication, since it requires a previously available name, but invalid because of homonymy. To record this in TaxonWorks, a new Protonym for a misapplied name should be created in the database. This Protonym should be linked to two other Taxon Names with two Taxon Name Relationships. The first relationship is to an available name with the same spelling (it could be a valid name or a synonym). The relationship type is &quot;Misapplication&quot;. The second relationship &quot;Invalidating&quot; relationship should link this TaxonName to the correct name for this taxon.

If you create the type specimen for the Taxon Name, there is a field for the type repository. To create the type specimen follow one of the links provided in the Edit Taxon Name task, either <em>Quick</em> or <em>Comprehensive</em> in the <em>Type</em> section. <em>Quick type specimen</em> task allow to copy the entire verbatim-label information. The <em>Comprehensive collection object</em> allow to provide more detailed information about the specimen.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-get-to-the-place-in-tw-where-i-can-add-a-new-basionym-i-need-to-try-it-out-and-see-what-happens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-to-the-place-in-tw-where-i-can-add-a-new-basionym-i-need-to-try-it-out-and-see-what-happens" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I get to the place in TW where I can add a new basionym?

But when the name has been historically treated as a synonym, and subsequently was restored, the best practice would be to preserve both treatments in the database. Keep the synonym Taxon Name Relationship with its original citation in the database. Add the nomenclatural Status <em>Valid</em> to the name. This status will overwrite the Taxon Name relationship.

Once unavailable, the taxon name keeps this status. The taxon could be described in a subsequent publication by the same or a different author(s), with the same or a different spelling. Both names in TaxonWorks should be regarded as separate protonyms. <em>Nomen nudum</em> should be marked with one or several of the appropriate nomenclatural statuses: <em>nomen nudum</em> or, preferrably, a more specific one, for example <em>nomen nudum: no description</em>.

This new taxon name should be linked to the original name using special Taxon Name Relationship <em>Incorrect original spelling</em> or <em>Family group name original form</em>. TW could be restrictive in the ending of the original name before you assigne the relationship, so it is recommended to save the Taxon Name with the proper ending, add the ralationship and return back to modify the <em>Name</em> to the original form.
