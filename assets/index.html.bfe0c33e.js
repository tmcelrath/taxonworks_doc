If it isn’t found in the search box in the Source Hub, &#39;—None—&#39; will appear below it.

If it works (it usually does), most of the fields you need will be filled in. Be sure to <em>check them</em>, as they are not always correct.</li><li>If you have the reference in BibTex format (most reference databases will output this), you can input it here. <ul><li>From Zotero, simply select the reference, right-click on it, select &quot;export item&quot; and save the file as BibTeX.</li><li>From EndNote, select the reference and fill out the &quot;label&quot; field. Then go to File &gt; export and select &quot;text file&quot;, &quot;BibTeX export&quot;. Most people don’t fill out the &quot;label&quot; field in their EndNote database, but if you don’t, you will have to add the label manually by editing the exported text file (that is the field highlighted in the example below).</li><li>In the <code>New Source Form</code>, Choose the blue <code>BibTex</code> box at the top of the screen, and paste in the exported *.txt file. (No drag and drop here).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Most of the fields may be self-explanatory. Here we note a few tricks, for instance:</p><ul><li><p>Entering an author name in this box (5) <code>Authors</code> tries to pull it up from the table of known authors. If it isn’t found, you can use the <code>Add New</code> button that appears in this case. This is an advantage in some situations over entering authors as verbatim text (in the Verbatim from BibTex field lower in the screen), because you can easily pull them up later, for example, when adding author names to new species.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, below the <code>Author</code> section is a search box for <code>Serials</code> (journals). If the journal is not found, look for the <code>New</code> button to the right of the Serial screen. This opens a screen for you to add a serial to the serials table.</p></li><li><p>Once you have created the new source, you should go to <code>Documentation</code> in the blue <code>Radial annotator</code> to the right of the <code>Source</code> and upload the PDF file if available.</p></li><li><p>(Optional) Use the TW <code>Tag</code> feature to group and track which papers need data parsing or do not.</p><ul><li>To do this go to the Tags choice in the <code>Radial annotator</code></li><li>Tag the source as desired (e.g. <code>Unprocessed</code>)</li><li>And add other suitable tags such as <code>No Nomenclatural Acts</code> or <code>Nomenclatural Acts</code> as appropriate (this is specific for the UCD project, other projects may use different tags).</li></ul></li><li><p>If a source has a title in a language other than English, and you wish to enter the English translation (or translation in any other language), follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Enter the source with the title as given in the paper and create it.</li><li>Click on the blue <code>Radial BibTex annotator</code> to the right of the source at the top of the page, and click on the pie slice for <code>Alternate Values</code>.</li><li>Choose title from the pick-list, the language for the translated title, and paste the translation in the Value field.</li><li>Be sure to <code>Save</code> it (green button) if this is a new source. Then the original title and translation will both be rendered.</li></ul><p>As all fields are present on the data entry screen for all types of sources, it can be a bit confusing, particularly for books and chapters in books. The article type for a chapter in a book is &quot;Inbook&quot;, and the book title would go into the Booktitle field. For books, there are fields for Editors, Series (if needed), Booktitle, Publisher, and Address (usually city or city and country).

For species-level names there are four possibilities:</p><ol><li><code>Adjective</code>. Most species epithets are probably treated as adjectives, for example, Signiphora flavella meaning a yellow species. These will change their ending if moved to a genus with a different gender. Names with the suffix “-ensis” (usually referring to a place), change the ending only if put in combination with a genus name that is neuter, in which case it becomes “-ense”.</li><li><code>Noun in Apposition</code>. These don’t change gender when transferred to other genera with a different gender. An example might be a name like <em>Aphelinus mali</em>, named after the common host, the woolly apple aphid. An arbitrary combination of letters is treated as a noun.</li><li><code>Noun in genitive case</code>. These are commonly patronyms, ending in “-i” for males and “-ae” for females.</li><li><code>Participle</code>. A participle is an adjectival form of a verb. These are treated as adjectives, and they must agree in gender with the genus name.</li></ol></li><li><p>There is a text field to capture the <code>Etymology</code>, in most cases you can simply paste this text from the publication.</p></li><li><p>Be sure to <code>Save</code> all the information (green <code>Save</code> button at upper right) before moving to the <code>Type</code> screen. (UCD prefers to enter <code>Type</code> information last, after everything else on this page has been saved).</p></li></ul><p>In most cases, the <code>Quick type</code> screen will provide all the details you need to enter information on the type, and this is what we show below. However, if you have other information to add for the type, such as Lat/Long data, you will need to use the <code>Comprehensive</code> form.</p><ul><li><p>First, pick the nature of the <code>type</code> (for most new species this will be a holotype), provide the <code>source</code> (click blue <code>pin</code> button if source is the <code>default</code>), and the <code>page number</code>(s) on which the type is designated. The rest of the information on the type is filled in with the screen below.</p><ol><li>In most cases, the type will be a new specimen, not already in TW as an <code>Existing Collection Object</code>. If so, click <code>New</code>.</li><li>Paste the label data for the type into <code>Buffered Collecting</code> event. This is a verbatim text field.</li><li>In most cases, you can ignore <code>Buffered determinations</code>, and <code>Buffered other labels</code>.</li><li>Total is number of specimens (one for a holotype).</li><li>Designate the <code>preparation type</code> (pin, slide-mount, there are several choices).</li><li>The <code>Repository</code> is the institution where the type is deposited. Hopefully the repository will be in the TW table, otherwise you may need to create it using the <code>Repositories card</code> in the Data portfolio.</li><li><code>Collection Event</code> refers to a specimen already in the TW database, which in most cases will not be the case if you are curating a new species description.</li><li>In <code>Biocurations</code>, indicate whether the type is an adult or immature, and a male or female.</li><li>Finally, you enter the Identifier for the type, which consists of two parts. You must first Search for the <code>Namespace</code> (see the Glossary above) of the collection in which the type is deposited. Note that this may be different from the repository (a single institution may have several collections, each with a different “namespace”). Think of the <code>namespace</code> as the part of a specimen ID number that does not change for each specimen, for example, <code>TAMU</code> in <code>TAMU x01234567</code>. If the namespace is not in the database, you may need to create it, but since these are shared across projects, there is a good chance it will be there. Once you have selected the namespace, paste in the type or specimen number (only) in the <code>Identifier</code> field, and hit the green <code>Create</code> button.</li></ol></li></ul><p>[INSERT SCREENSHOT]</p><p>If you wish to add <code>paratypes</code> (optional), you essentially follow the same process for each one.</p><p>For many contemporary taxa, there may also be a <code>ZooBank number</code> associated with the species.

If the type-species or type-genus name is also new, probably the easiest path would be to create the family-level or genus-level name first, then create the name of the type-species or type-genus, and then return to the new genus-level or family-level name and indicate the type. If you enter an existing name in the <code>New Taxon Name</code> task and select it (assuming it is found), TW will take you to the <code>Edit Taxon Name</code> screen where you can enter the type information.</p><p>After you click <code>Create</code> and <code>Save</code> you should be returned to the <code>Browse Nomenclature</code> page:</p><p>[INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE]</p><p>If you have entered all the information correctly, it should be shown here.

However, the consensus in the UCD project seems to be that it is preferable to leave species groups as informal groupings without nomenclatural baggage. How then to indicate or record assignment to species groups? There are several options, each of which has strong and weak points. It is a &quot;policy decision&quot;. You will have to decide which option works best for your group.</p><p>One.</p><ul><li>Add the <code>species group designation</code> to the <code>OTU name</code> field using the <code>edit OTU</code> function.

Names of tribes and subtribes were treated as junior synonyms of their respective families. However, tribal and subtribal classifications are currently used in many families of chalcidoids. If you wish to incorporate these into classifications in UCD@TW, steps to follow are describe below. First, you must determine if the tribal or subtribal form of the name is in UCD@TW, treated as a synonym of the subfamily. See the entire scenario next.</p><p>One.</p><ul><li>To determine if the tribal or subtribal form of the name is in UCD@TW and treated as a synonym of the subfamily, go to <code>Browse Nomenclature</code>, <code>search</code> for the name, for example, <code>Coccophagini</code>. <ul><li>Be sure that you do not have the redirect to valid name box checked!</li><li>If you get a result showing the tribe (or subtribe) name in a black box to the right of the subfamily name (see below), the tribal form is in TW treated as a synonym of the subfamily.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In most cases, if the tribe or subtribe name has been used in the literature, it will show up as a synonym of the nominate subfamily. If it does not, you will need to create it, so skip to section Five below.</p><ul><li>Navigate to the name with the tribal name at right (not to the valid form of the subfamily name, which may come up without the tribe name in the black box). It will be shown as an invalid synonym of the subfamily.</li><li>Click the green <code>Edit</code> icon to move to the <code>Edit Taxon Name</code> form.</li><li><code>Show all ranks</code> in the <code>Basic Information</code> form and pick <code>tribe</code>.</li><li>Then change the suffix from <code>-inae</code> to <code>-ini</code> and pick the appropriate <code>parent</code>.</li></ul><p>Two.</p><ul><li>Scroll down to <code>Status</code>, <code>Show All</code>, and select <code>Valid</code>.</li><li>Provide the <code>citation</code> and <code>page number</code> using the <code>Radial annotator</code> to the right.</li></ul><p>Three.</p><ul><li>If you wish to provide a citation for this usage of the name, scroll down to <code>Classification</code>, choose <code>Set to Parent</code> (in this case it would be <code>Coccophagini</code>)</li><li>Choose <code>Source Classified As</code>.</li></ul><p>Four.</p><ul><li>One more (obsure) task remains. Using the <code>Navigate Radial icon</code><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/7w1dx2" width="20px/"> to the right of the tribal name at the top of the page, choose <code>Show</code></li><li>Then choose <code>Edit</code> in the menu bar at the top of the next screen. This takes you to an older version of the <code>Edit Taxon Name</code> form.</li><li>If a name appears in the <code>Verbatim Name</code> field at the bottom of the screen (like <code>Coccophaginae ), </code>delete<code>it and click the green</code>Update Taxon Name` button. This removes an artifact created when tribal or subtribal names were imported as synonyms from TW@NHM.</li></ul><p>Continue from this point only if the tribal or subtribal form of the name did not show up as synonym when you searched for it in step One above. Most likely, in this case it has not been used at this hierachical level before. If it does not show up, create it using the following process.</p><p>Five.</p><ul><li>Navigate to the taxon name at the subfamily level, for example, Coccophaginae (via <code>Browse Nomenclature</code>) and move to the <code>Edit Taxon Name</code> screen.</li><li>Create the name at the tribal or subtribal level, for example, Coccophagini. The best way to do this is to <code>Clone</code> the subfamily level name (see green button in upper right), as this will retain the author and date, type genus, and other historical information. <code>Select all the boxes</code> to retain all historical information and type <code>CLONE</code> in the box. This will active the green <code>Clone</code> button. Note that you are creating a taxon name here, not an OTU, which is a separate issue.</li></ul><p>Six.</p><ul><li>Navigate to the tribal (or subtribal) name in <code>Browse Nomenclature</code> and move to the <code>Edit Taxon Name</code> screen.</li><li><code>Pick</code> the rank (tribe) and change the ending to <code>-ini</code>.</li><li>Change the <code>parent</code>.
